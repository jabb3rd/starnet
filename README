This is a Fujian Star-Net AR800 remote control tool that works via telnet.
It implements some useful commands, for example:

* ARP table request
* MAC table request
* Execution of a raw command
* WPS PIN request
* Ping a set of given hosts returning alive ones

TODO:

Make some firewall interaction fun (detecting/adding/removing/changing iptables rules).
